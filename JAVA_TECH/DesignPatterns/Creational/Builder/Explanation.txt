📌 Category: Creational Pattern
📌 Purpose:
Separate construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

🛠️ When to use:
When an object has many optional parameters or complex construction.

To avoid constructors with many parameters (telescoping constructor anti-pattern).

Example: Building complex objects like StringBuilder, configuring HTTP requests.

do we need to follow this pattern for every POJO?
No, use it when the object construction is complex or has many optional parameters.
For simple objects, a constructor or factory method is sufficient.
